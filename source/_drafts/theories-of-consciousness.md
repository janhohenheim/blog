## Preeliminaries

To understand the terms used in this post, here is a very quick and dirty rundown of the relevant concepts. Many of these have historically be interpreted in very different ways. In my opinion, a lot of time is wasted today arguing about their exact definition, so I will very briefly state which definitions are used. To not get bogged dopwn by semantics, I keep the definitions intentionally very broad and short.   
Whole books can be written about any of these, but we will be satisfied with a few sentences instead today. Each definition links to its corresponding Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry for further reading.

- [The Mind-Body Problem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/): How do physical states in the brain correspond to mental states? How does one result from the other?

- [Qualia](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/qualia/): The subjective experience of… stuff. The way the color red looks to you. The fact that pain does not just feel like a generic input but, well, painful. "an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: [the ways things seem to us](https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/254/1/quinqual.htm)". Define the term any further and you will have people debating wether qualia exists at all or not. Whenever I use this term in this post, think about this very simple definition and forget any further technicalities you might already know of.

- [The Chinese Room](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/): Say there's a person in a room. There's a slit where people push letters in Chinese in. The operator in the room does not speak nor read Chinese at all, but there are some thick books in the room telling them how to handle the (for them) incomprehensible symbols. Based on these instructions, they assemble a response out of a series of symbols and return it through the slit. The person outside the box is then abnle to read a perfectly fine answer to their letter, written in Chinese, and will thus conclude that there is a person inside the room that is fluent in Chinese. But there isn't. What's up here? Note that this thought experiment was originally designed to provide an argument for why computers might never achieve a real understanding of the world and thus could never be conscious, but there are several authors who disagree with this conclusion in many interesting ways.

- [Philosophical Zombies](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/zombies/): A hypothetical living being that outwardly behaves exactly like a conscious person but actually experiences no qualia. Give it a piece of chocolate and it will happily say thanks and appear to enjoy wating it, all the while there is no consciousness experiencing any of it. Basically, a Chinese Room in the form of a person[^0]. We will encounter different opinions on whether the thought experiment is a) conceivable in your imagination and b) possible in reality.

- [The Teletransporter Paradox]():

- [The _ Problem of Consciousness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#ProExpSuc)
  - Easy: how do the physical and chemical processes in the brain result in our behavior? The word "easy" is used tongue-in-cheek.
  - Hard: why is behavior accompanied by consciousness? If we can explain all human behavior as a series of processes going on in the neurons, why is there "a light on inside". Why are we not all philosophical zombies?
  - Real: how do the physical and the chemical processes in the brain result in the properties we associate with consciousness? This formulation evolved as an answer to the [perceived inadequacy of the easy and hard problems](https://aeon.co/essays/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-is-a-distraction-from-the-real-one).

I will summarize what, through my own conclusions, each of the theories presented has to say about some of these problems. I highlight them because the answer to what happens to zombies teleporting into chinese rooms has extreme consequences for the feasability of mind uploading, which is a topic very dear to me.

All right, all cought up? Again, if you know these already, you might be angry at me for not doing them justice, I know. But they are not the focus of this post, so we must compromise.

## Mysterianism

In 1989 Colin McGinn asked himself "[Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fmind%2FXCVIII.391.349)". His humble conclusion: probably not [^1]. Probably never. In fact, even if we had the solution right in front of us, we might not be able to comprehend it as such. For all we know, someone might have already found out all there is to how consciousness arises in the brain, but we are doomed to never be happy with physical explanations for a phenomenon that seems so magical to us.  
While the fact that you are currently reading a blog post about more than one theory of consciousness already gives away that I do not agree with this view, I will do my best to explain it in good faith.  

### Intuition versus reality

The reason for our ignorance is that our understanding of what consciousness even *is*, can only be formulated using whatever kind of consciousness we happen to *have*. But we have no reason to believe that our minds are able of omniscient. Try understanding the [Monty Hall Problem](https://www.montyhallproblem.com/) *intuitively* and you will very quickly make acquaintance with your mental limits. Annectotally, at least for me, doing an undergrad minor in statistics deeply humbled my limits of intuition. Let me recount my favorite example. Say you're dealt 13 out of 52 standard playing cards. Call the chance of getting two aces **A**. Now imagine a second round, in which I tell you that I know that you already have at least one ace in your hand. The chance of holding two aces in this scenario is **B**. Lastly I tell you that the ace I know you're holding happens to be the ace of spades. The chance of holding two aces is now **C**. Can you sort **A**, **B** and **C**? The obvious solution is **A** < **B** = **C**, but [the actual, mind-boggling answer is **A** < **B** < **C**](https://www.usna.edu/Users/physics/mungan/_files/documents/Scholarship/TwoAces.pdf). I was so surprised by this result when I first encountered it that I wrote a computer simulation to test it, and yes, the math is right. Clearly my grasp of how reality works could not have been as good as my intuition wanted to tell me[^2].

Just as it will always be beyond the grasp of a dog to understand how its own liver works, it might be beyond our grasp to understand how consciousness works. 

### The march of science

You might interject: "Aha! But in contrast to a dog, we have the steady advance of science! We simply have not yet found the answer, but surely we can get closer and closer until we reach it!". Not so fast. McGinn has thought of this too:

> People sometimes ask me if I am still a mysterian, as if perhaps the growth of neuroscience has given me pause; they fail to grasp the depth of mystery I sense in the problem. The more we know of the brain, the less it looks like a device for creating consciousness: it's just a big collection of biological cells and a blur of electrical activity - [all machine and no ghost](https://web.archive.org/web/20120227234512/https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2012/02/consciousness-mind-brain).

Even if we already had the solution to the problem of consciousness right in front of us, we wouldn't accept it. Our own consciousness *feels* special, it feels so much as if we had a soul in us that we cannot but think of our mind as something otherwordly. No matter that I am a convinced determinist, I still feel so much as if I had free will that it borders on an irrational feeling of *knowing*. For this reason, we will never intuitively accept a theory of consciousness that explains us in terms of flesh and electricity, much less so in terms of a set of equations.

### And I don't buy it

All that said, it seems to me that any claim that contains the word "never" is a bit bold. Putting such an emphasis on how we feel about ourselves is also too speculative for my taste. Sure, it is a strange situation to have a consciousness try to understand the phenomenon of consciousness through the less of its own consciousness. A [strange loop](#Strange-Loops-and-Tangled-Hierarchies), yes, but is this necessarily limiting us in any fundamental way?

Recall my example of how I could not comprehend how by virtue of just knowing that there is a space drawn on my ace, my chance of holding two aces increases. I eventually understood the intuition behind the solution, but it still competes with the primal intuition I first formed when looking at the problem.
Here, my mind is also holding a conflicting set of beliefs: one thinks the result is magical, the other one knows it is mundane. This does not hinder me from understanding the solution because as a human I have the ability of metacognition, noticing the flaws in the way my mind works if I look carefully enough.

TODO: Add ambiguous image like "My Wife and My Mother-in-Law". Just as I can flip between seeing a young and an old woman but never both at the same time, I can flip between the intuitive and the real answer to problems my intuition is not built for.

Granted, I will probably always see my consciousness as magical, but that should not stop me from also knowing that it is not. Just as I have the ability to see the world as deterministic even though everything in my being screams against it, I believe one day someone will be able to see the way flesh and electricity, and even mere equations, give rise to consciousness

### Stances (according to me)

| Topic | Stance |
|-|-|
| Mind-Body Problem | Not able to be answered. |
| Chinese Room | Not able to be answered. | 
| Philosophical Zombies | Conceivable, but their physical plausibility is not able to be answered. |
| Teletransportation Paradox | Not able to be answered. |

## Cartesian Dualism

Long ago, René Descartes tried doubting as much as he could. He found he could doubt that his body existed; after all, an evil demon might be controlling his perceptions in a dream [^3]. But while he was doubting, he noticed that *he* was doubting. Since doubting cannot happen without someone doing it, he concluded that by the mere act of doubting he must fail to doubt his own existence. In fancy latin: "Dubito, ergo sum", or, its more famous cousin, "Cogito, ergo sum". Since the mind and body thus don't share a property, namely whether we can doubt their existence or not, he further concluded that mind and body cannot be the same thing.

All of this led Descartes to separate the world into res extensa, the physical stuff whose existance can be doubted, and res cogitans, the thinking stuff which must exist. This means that the thinking stuff can be concieved to be able to exist independent of any physical stuff. To explain this, Descartes concludes that consciousness resides in a different realm than physics.  

A solipsist might not not extend this privilege to others, since their exclamations of the cogito could still be the works of the evil demon. Animals in particular are often imagined as flesh robots with no mind stuff at all in this view.

### Does Batman Exist?

There have been numerous refutations of this argument, but I retell my favorite one. Imagine Batman and the Joker facing each other in a room. Barring any evil demons, the Joker cannot doubt the existence of Batman, because he right there with him. But the Joker can doubt the existence of Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, who might have been killed by the Joker's goons. Thus, he wrongly concludes that since he can doubt the existence of Bruce Wayne but not of Batman, they cannot be the same person.

In short: just because you can imagine a state of the world doesn't mean it's logically possible. Keep this in mind for philosophical zombies.

In addition, I must reject a central claim in the argument: given my current knowledge of computational neuroscience, I cannot *really* imagine a world where consciousness exists without some kind of physical substrate.

### Dualism Today

This theory of consciousness is quite different from the others discussed insofar that it is the only one that does not assume physicalism, i.e. that all phenomena are the result of physical interactions. I included it because it's arguably the globally most accepted theory. This might surprise you. The reason is that having a way that consciousness can exist independently of physical phenomena is the only mechanism by which most[^4] religions can plausibly promise a life after death. Thus, most religious people have implicitely accepted Cartesian Dualism, even if they are not aware of it. For religions positing the existence of a soul, we can directly equate it with the aforementioned mind stuff. 
On the other hand, physicalists are far from a generally accepted framework of consciousness, as this post should be able to tell you.


### Stances (according to me)

| Topic | Stance |
| - | - |
| Mind-Body Problem | The mind exists independedly of any physical reality, so the body does not give rise to it at all. |
| Chinese Room | Since physical stuff cannot create mind stuff, the chinese room is not conscious. |
| Philosophical Zombies | Conceivable and realistic, they are just people without mind stuff |
| Teletransporter Paradox | Since mind stuff is indivisible, the person on the other end cannot be you. Physical stuff cannot create mind stuff, the person on the other end cannot be conscious, making them a philosophical zombie, since per the premise of the thought experiment they are indistinguishable from you. Since philosophical zombies are inconcievable, the premise must be flawed: such a teleporter cannot exist in the first place. |


## Global Workspace Theory

Think about what activities of your mind you can consciously perceive. You are aware of the images in front of your eye (or your [illusion thereof](#Predictive-Processing)). You can be aware of your emotions. You are aware of whether you're feeling a bit cold or too hot. You are aware of this sentence you're reading.  
Now imagine all the things going on in your mind that are not currently part of your consciousness. There's passive information, like how this blog post started. If you think about it, you might recall the words, so the information must be stored in your brain. But had I not prompted you, you would probably not have thought about them. Similarly, even though you're not aware of it in this very moment, you can instantly bring the time you planned on going to bed today into your consciousness.  
Then there's also activity that you cannot bring into your consciousness. You cannot perceive how your hypothalamus decides which hormones the pituary gland should secrete. You cannot perceive how a memory is formed or erased. Ever had the the feeling you were being watched, but did not know why you felt that way? Your brain apparently generated a hypothesis, but you had no access to it [^5].  

Think about the last movie you saw. Close your eyes and try to list as many names of characters in the movie as you can, including minor roles.  
Done? Now ask yourself: what exactly happened when you tried to recall the names? If you're like me, flashes of some scenes might have popped into your head and some dialog started playing in your memories. The protagonists and villains came up instantly, and when remembering the story, some side characters will have come up as well. But the really interesting part is when you hit the metaphorical brick wall and know there are some missing names that you just cannot recall. You already went through the plot and all scenes you remember and are stuck. No methods are helping anymore. You concentrate on... something? And poof, at some point a new name comes into your mind after all. What happened the second before you remembered the name? Your mind was clearly doing something, otherwise you wouldn't have gotten a result, but the action is hidden to you [^6].  

### The Theater of the Mind

So, some things are part of our consciousness, some are not. This is often viewed through the metaphor of the [mind as a theater](https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/steen/cogweb/Abstracts/Baars_88.html).
There is an audience in front of it, but they are kept in absolute darkness. The only people visible are the actors playing thoughts on the stage, because they are illuminated by the spotlight of consciousness. Sometimes an actor leaves the stage, sometimes another one enters. Sometimes the spotlight is smaller, sometimes bigger. But the spotlight always remains the only light in the room.  

Different theories of consciousness interpret the metaphor in different ways. Global Workspace Theory interprets the audience as unconscious thinking modules of the brain. They might have discussions and do all sorts of things, but they are not under the spotlight and thus can only communicate with their neighbors. The actors are the items in your consciousness, and the stage they're on is the titular global workspace, visible to all other guests in the room.  
The key idea here is that mental items like thoughts can be generated by different parts of the brain, but are locally confined. Through some mechanism, be it a heuristic of importance or a voting system, a thought can be "upgraded" and enter the global workspace. This makes it available to other brain areas and to your consciousness. The claim is ideed that the content of our consciousness is *identical* to the content of the global workspace.

### A Small and Neat Idea

You may have noticed that the given explanation does not address the Hard Problem of consciousness at all. One can argue that is doesn't address the Real Problem either, since it is not concerned with exploring how things appear to us, but only when. It only talks about the *contents* of consciousness, not consciousness itself. In its simplest form, it simply states that a global workspace is *necessary* for consciousness. Of course, some authors go beyond: the strictest form states that the [global workspace *is* consciousness](https://www.edge.org/conversation/stanislas_dehaene-signatures-of-consciousness).

I think the theory offers a nice part of a grander puzzle. The simple form is such a nicely behaving hypothesis with a small scope and intuitive claim that it can easily be plugged into other more encompassing theories. Different authors offer specific mechanisms of where in brain the postulated global workspace is found, how information is pushed there and how it disperses through the brain. This lets researchers generate testable hypothesis and make the theory thus [realistically experimentally falsifiable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656553/), which makes it doubly sympathetic in my mind. We will see that many other theories, interesting though they might be, do not offer this essential feature.  

There is one notable conflict though: this view predicts that an empty global workspace results in no contents of consciousness and vice versa. What then is the reported feeling of "pure consciousness devoid of content except for this experience" reported during deep meditation? It seems like the only answer global workspace theory can provide is that there must still be some kind of item left, and thus the "devoidness of content" is a mere illusion.

### Stances (according to me)

| Topic | Stance |
| - | - |
| Mind-Body Problem | The contents of consciousness are the mental items that are made globally accessible to the brain. |
| Chinese Room | No stance, but the strong form would predict that a Chinese Room implementing a global workspace as part of its algorithm is conscious. |
| Philosophical Zombies | No stance, but since the zombie's brain presumably includes a global workspace, the stronger form denies their possibility. |
| Teletransporter Paradox | No stance on individuality or continuity, but since the global workspace was duplicated, the two versions of the passenger at least have identical contents of consciousness. But this is presumably given in the premise anyways. |

## Predictive Processing

## Integrated Information Theory
panpsychism

## Strange Loops and Tangled Hierarchies

This one is tough to write about without rambling on, since the book introducing this view, "Gödel, Escher, Bach", is my favorite piece of writing in the whole world. But I'll do my best.

Whatever theory of the mind one might favor, it seems apparent that we have some kind of inner representation of objects and concepts. Let's call these representation "symbols". Not as in mathematical or written symbols, but as in a symbolic unit of meaning. For example, when you look at a fork, you cannot but instantly recognize it as a fork. Your mind fetches this "fork" symbol automatically and binds it to the image of the fork. We will call this "activating a symbol". Symbols can also be of abstract objects like democracy or of the color yellow. Note that we are not making any claim about where and how this symbol is manifested in your brain, we are just noting that this phenomenon seems to exists.

It also seems apparent that we can create new symbols. Here's a fun fact: did you know the Swiss have a unique national sport called ["Hornussen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTDWnq2ZBI)? It's like a mix of gold and baseball. Instead of a ball, you have a small light puck. The player beating it must wildly swing a big wiggly stick with a small head around to hit the puck. The stick looks like a gigantic bottle cleaning brush and handles like a 2 meter long bendy ruler, so the act of swinging it around looks quite fun.  
The puck then flies into the field while doing a buzzing noise, which is why its called a "Hornuss", a local Swiss word for hornet. In the field waits the other team holding big stop signs, with which they try to catch the Hornuss. If they fail and the Hornuss lands, they get one penalty point per 10 meters of flying distance. The team with the least total points wins.

And just like that, you created a new symbol for this new sport you've probably never heard of. Symbols also seem to be interconnected. When you think about Hornussen, which other symbols instantly come into your mind? For me it's open fields, two teams and a silly stick. Thinking about these symbols in turn shows their connections, ad infinitum. 

Seen like this, our brain is a machine for creating, activating, connecting and manipulating symbols.

### Interactions with the world

Imagine a very young child called Douglas and his friend playing with a ball. To do so, it seems plausible that they must either already possess a symbol for "ball" or are forming one right now, while playing. The friend decides to bounce the ball off a wall and see what happens. It throws the ball, which flies towards the wall, bounces off and returns to the child. While watching and laughing, Douglas' symbol creating mind starts forming symbols for "bouncy", connected to "ball" [^7], and "thrower", connected to the symbol Douglas created for his friend.  
Excited, Douglas wants to try as well. He throws the ball, not as straight as his friend did, but well enough to the wall. Just as before, the ball bounces back and lands at his feet. His symbol for "bouncy" gets strenghened and is still connected to "wall". But what is the symbol for "thrower" connected to now? If he didn't have a symbol for it yet, this is a magical moment: Douglas just formed a symbol for himself, the "I". While growing up, Douglas' symbol for "I" will become more complex. At around the age of 4, his theory of mind will be [strong enough to know that his own knowledge is not the same as everyone else's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGSj2zY2OEM). The video I linked is extremely cute, please take a break from reading and watch it.  

Back? Alright. This meta-understanding of his own knowledge means that it makes sense to connect his "I" symbol with all knowledge he has, which is all his symbols. But "all his symbols" includes "I" as well, making it an endless recursion. We can come to this conclusion via another route as well: to think ahead of time about his choices, Douglas must be able to simulate parts of the world, including him. But, to simulate himself, he must simulate that he knows about himself, which means that the symbol for his simulated "I" must also include a symbol for himself.  
This "I" symbol is from now on always activated as the actor suspected behind whatever course of action the processes in the brain are following.

### Strange Loops and where to find them

This kind of recursiveness, where you can descend and descend a hierarchy only to find yourself right where you started, is called a "strange loop", and can be found in the paintings of M.C. Esher, the music of J.S. Bach and the proof of the incompleteness theorem of Kurt Gödel. The system of symbols containing a strange loop is called a "tangled hierarchy" [^8].

The central claim of the theory is that the vague feeling of being consciousness is nothing but the qualia resulting from the "I" symbol being active and thus telling you that there is an autonomous agent responsible for what you do, namely "I". In this sense, the "I" is a complete illusion, maybe even more so than in the other theories.

All of this does not require a meat hardware, of course. In fact, any sufficiently powerful system capable of a) creating symbols and b) interacting with the world will inevitably create an "I" symbol. The more sophisticated the ability to manipulate symbol and the more possibilities for interaction the system has, the more complex the tangled hierarchy will be and by extent, the more complex the "I" symbol will be. The theory claims that this complexity is what makes us feel like we are very conscious. If consciousness itself is an illusion, the complexity of the illusion will determine how convincing it is.

### Beyond the own body

There are some very interesting concequences of this view. The first one is that all systems containing symbols can be placed in a hierarchy of ascending consciousness. This of course depends on what which organisation of information you precisely define as "symbol", which is intentionally left blank to be filled by neuroscience since, again, it seems reasonable to assert that they must somehow exist. But at least for humans, this forces us to conclude that babies are less conscious than children, that children are less conscious than adults and that some adults are more conscious than others. This puts an interesting twist on the trolley problem that forces one to pick between a group of adults and a group of children.  

The most radical consequence however comes from the fact that we can not only simulate ourself in hypothetical situations, but others as well. But to simulate someone else, I must also simulate their consciousness, which means I must simulate the strange loop of their "I" symbol. But activating an "I" symbol is exactly what we defined as consciousness before! This means that simulating another person, for example when pretending to be them, remembering them, dreaming of them, thinking about what they would do in a situation, etc. runs a low-fidelity version of their consciousness. This is very easy to dismiss because of how unintuitive it is, but give it a try. Think about the closest person to you that you know. Look at the room you're in. Now, pretend as realistically as you can to be that person for 60 seconds. Set a timer so you don't have to think about the time. Think what they would think while looking around. Don't think about what exactly would go through their mind, just think it directly.  

Done? The argument is that for this short moment, your consciousness took a back seat and another was active. The only reason it might not feel like it, is that you never lost your sense of agency and that you can remember the experience afterwards.  
In this sense, the teletransportation paradox is real and very mundane. You already exist multiple times: one version is inside your own brain, with a very high complexity, but hundreds of versions are in the brains of your friends and family. It also means that when you die, it is not as if a candle is extinguished, but as a fire slowly burning out. Every time your close ones gather to reminisce about you, they refresh their memories of you, exchange information about you that some might not have had and thus strenghten their symbols of you.  
And no matter if you buy the theory or not, you have to admit one thing: that is a damn beautiful thought.

### Stances

This time, the stances come directly from the horse's mouth, since they are all addressed in the book "I Am a Strange Loop" (2007)  

| Topic | Stance |
| - | - |
| Mind-Body Problem | The body is a machine for producing symbols of reality. The symbol representing the "I" being active feels as if we were an autonomous actor |
| Chinese Room | If the algorithm can in fact always produce a perfectly human answer, it stands to reason it must be able to create symbols and simulate interactions of itself with the world. After all, you can explain to it what Hornussen is and how it would imagine itself playing it. Thus, it must be able to create an "I" symbol and is thus conscious. |
| Philosophical Zombies | Via the same argument as with the Chinese Room, the behavior of the zombie means it must have an "I" symbol and is thus conscious. The zombie is in this view not even conscievable. |
| Teletransporter Paradox | Both people are equally you. It's okay to kill the version on Earth, since this means nothing more than a few seconds of memory are lost. Don't fear the reaper. |


## Attention Schema Theory

The brain is constantly bombarded by external and internal input. With this gigantic flow of data, it is impossible to treat them all the same way; the brain has to prioritize. It does this by [upregulating some signals and downregulating others](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18694779/). Attention Schema Theory defines *attention* as this upregulated data. It then postulates that there probably exists a control mechanism in the brain that shifts attention as needed. Since it is assumed that the brain creates models of physical and abstract objects in the world, it would make sense to create such a model of its own attention. This model, called the *attention schema*, is fed to and manipulated by the controlling agent. The model is not perfect, but it is a good and fast enough approximation to be useful in guiding attention. The attention schema resides within the [Global Workspace](#Global-Workspace-Theory) we've discussed before. Thus, the contents of the attention schema are at the same time the contents of consciousness. 
The feeling of this *being me* comes from the imperfections in the simplified model of attention. Just as we have an imperfect model of our body, we have an imperfect model of our attention, of our experience available to all our brain regions. Thus, if anything came to ask whatever part of our brain if it had an experience, it would state "yes, I have data right here saying that I have an experience!". This is the illusion of consciousness. [(Graziano 2022)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116933119)

### The Social Brain

Since our ancestors evolved in social contexts, it would make sense to be able to have models of other organism's attention. We have already evolved a way to model our own attention, namely the attention schema, so we can use the same trick to create attention schemata of others. When these models gather our attention, they are moved to the global workspace, where they also become part of our consciousness. (Consciousness and the Social Brain, Graziano 2013)  
This means that we evolve empathy from consciousness. While some social theories of consciousness assert that consciousness is nothing but theory of mind turned inwards (accidentally implying autistic people are less conscious than neurotypical people), Attention Schema Theory says the opposite. Theory of mind is formed by applying the assumption that we are conscious to others.  
A very interesting and delightfully contrarian concequence of this view is the conclusion that it might be very important to make sure our AI is conscious as soon as possible, so that it can act with compassion instead of seeing people as mere objects [(Graziano 2017)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2017.00060/full).

### Strange Loops all the Way Down

Since in the view of Attention Schema Theory consciousness is nothing but an attention schema running on global workspace, we land at the some of the same unintuitive conclusions as we did with [Strange Loops](#Beyond-the-own-Body). Our low fidelity models of other people are also conscious.  
Another similarity is the necessicity of attention, thus attention schemata and thus consciousness in brains [(Graziano 2015)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full).

These parallels should be no surprise. Attention Schema Theory is basically a more rigorous combination of strange loops and global workspace theory. We just use a strange loop between the actively changing attention and the descriptive attention schema instead of the strange loop of "I". Our model of attention contains our attention, which contains our model of attention, etc. The following quote uses the term "awareness" instead of "consciousness", but it puts it quite nicely[^9]:

> Attention is an active process, a data-handling style that boosts this or that chunk of information in the brain. In contrast, awareness is a description, a chunk of information, a reflection of the ongoing state of attention. Yet because of the strange loop between awareness and attention, the functions of the two are blurred together. Awareness becomes just as much of an active controller as attention. Awareness helps direct signals in the brain, enhancing some, suppressing others, guiding choices and actions.  (Consciousness and the Social Brain, Graziano 2013)

### Stances (according to me)

The stances end up being the same as for strange loops.

| Topic | Stance |
| - | - |
| Mind-Body Problem | The brain's information is in a competition for attention. Winners are summarized in a model called the attention schema, which resides in the global workspace and is thus the content of our consciousness |
| Chinese Room | Since the Chinese Room demonstrates social intelligence, it must be conscious. |
| Philosophical Zombies | Via the same argument as with the Chinese Room, the behavior of the zombie means it must have a model of its own attention to be able to model others'. The zombie is in this view not even conscievable. |
| Teletransporter Paradox | Both people are equally you, since the contents of their global workspace are identical. It's okay to kill the version on Earth, since this means nothing more than a few seconds of memory are lost. Don't fear the reaper. |

## Conclusion


[^0]: Not to be confused with a Chinese person; those are definitely conscious.

[^1]: Actually, the essay states that "The answer to the question that forms my title is therefore 'No' and 'Yes'".   
This nuance is meant to allow the possibility that we might find the solution but just not accept it as such, see the paragraph after the footnote.

[^2]: If you're interested in understanding the intuition, pay attention to the last few sentences of the linked paper, concerning the probability of two siblings being boys. Try to draw all the possible cases on paper, this should give you an intuition. The intuition for the aces is then just a natural extension of what you just did. Although calculating the actual numbers requires understanding of combinatorics, the intuition behind the result does not.

[^3]: Interestingly, Descartes anticipated the Brain in a vat scenario and by extent parts of the simulation hypothesis some 300 years before they were first formulated.

[^4]: The simulation hypothesis, which has surprisingly many parallels to conventional religions once you look for them, is the only one I can of that does not require Cartesian Dualism. This was today's edgy hot take, maybe I'll go into this in detail another day.

[^5]: A cool example of this is [this case study of hemispatial neglect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3205302/). Emphasis on the part with the house.

[^6]: If this is not relatable, try listing something else. The important part for this exercise is that all methodical approaches must fail to produce all items and you must in the end solely rely on whatever your brain is doing when you're just trying to remember. Think tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon.

[^7]: And possibly "wall", until the day he throws a plate at the wall and learns that the wall is in fact not responsible for the bouncy characteristic of certain materials, instead getting his "scolding" symbol activated

[^8]: Or more specifically a heterarchy, which is an organization where an item cannot have a unique rank in comparison to others. The item has either no rank or multiple different ones.

[^9]: Attention Schema Theory uses "awareness" everytime I use "consciousness" in its description, the distinction is only very slight. I find the terms "awareness" and "attention" too easy to mix up, so I stick with consciousness in this post.
