## Preeliminaries

To understand the terms used in this post, here is a very quick and dirty rundown of the relevant concepts. Whole books can be written about any of these, but we will be satisfied with a few sentences instead today.

### The Mind-Body Problem

### Qualia and Phenomenology

### Philosophical Zombies

### The somethingsomething Problem of Consciousness
- hard / easy / real problem of consciousness


All right, all cought up? Again, if you know these already, you might be angry at me for not doing them justice, I know. But they are not the focus of this post, so we must compromise.

## Mysterianism

In 1989 Colin McGinn asked himself "[Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fmind%2FXCVIII.391.349)". His humble conclusion: probably not [^1]. Probably never. In fact, even if we had the solution right in front of us, we might not be able to comprehend it as such. For all we know, someone might have already found out all there is to how consciousness arises in the brain, but we are doomed to never be happy with physical explanations for a phenomenon that seems so magical to us.  
While the fact that you are currently reading a blog post about more than one theory of consciousness already gives away that I do not agree with this view, I will do my best to explain it in good faith.  

### Intuition versus reality

The reason for our ignorance is that our understanding of what consciousness even *is*, can only be formulated using whatever kind of consciousness we happen to *have*. But we have no reason to believe that our minds are able of omniscient. Try understanding the [Monty Hall Problem](https://www.montyhallproblem.com/) *intuitively* and you will very quickly make acquaintance with your mental limits. Annectotally, at least for me, doing an undergrad minor in statistics deeply humbled my limits of intuition. Let me recount my favorite example. Say you're dealt 13 out of 52 standard playing cards. Call the chance of getting two aces **A**. Now imagine a second round, in which I tell you that I know that you already have at least one ace in your hand. The chance of holding two aces in this scenario is **B**. Lastly I tell you that the ace I know you're holding happens to be the ace of spades. The chance of holding two aces is now **C**. Can you sort **A**, **B** and **C**? The obvious solution is **A** < **B** = **C**, but [the actual, mind-boggling answer is **A** < **B** < **C**](https://www.usna.edu/Users/physics/mungan/_files/documents/Scholarship/TwoAces.pdf). I was so surprised by this result when I first encountered it that I wrote a computer simulation to test it, and yes, the math is right. Clearly my grasp of how reality works could not have been as good as my intuition wanted to tell me[^2].

Just as it will always be beyond the grasp of a dog to understand how its own liver works, it might be beyond our grasp to understand how consciousness works. 

### The march of science

You might interject: "Aha! But in contrast to a dog, we have the steady advance of science! We simply have not yet found the answer, but surely we can get closer and closer until we reach it!". Not so fast. McGinn has thought of this too:

> People sometimes ask me if I am still a mysterian, as if perhaps the growth of neuroscience has given me pause; they fail to grasp the depth of mystery I sense in the problem. The more we know of the brain, the less it looks like a device for creating consciousness: it's just a big collection of biological cells and a blur of electrical activity - [all machine and no ghost](https://web.archive.org/web/20120227234512/https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2012/02/consciousness-mind-brain).

Even if we already had the solution to the problem of consciousness right in front of us, we wouldn't accept it. Our own consciousness *feels* special, it feels so much as if we had a soul in us that we cannot but think of our mind as something otherwordly. No matter that I am a convinced determinist, I still feel so much as if I had free will that it borders on an irrational feeling of *knowing*. For this reason, we will never intuitively accept a theory of consciousness that explains us in terms of flesh and electricity, much less so in terms of a set of equations.

[^1]: Actually, the essay states that "The answer to the question that forms my title is therefore 'No' and 'Yes'".   
This nuance is meant to allow the possibility that we might find the solution but just not accept it as such, see the paragraph after the footnote.

[^2]: If you're interested in understanding the intuition, pay attention to the last few sentences of the linked paper, concerning the probability of two siblings being boys. Try to draw all the possible cases on paper, this should give you an intuition. The intuition for the aces is then just a natural extension of what you just did. Although calculating the actual numbers requires understanding of combinatorics, the intuition behind the result does not.

### And I don't buy it

All that said, it seems to me that any claim that contains the word "never" is a bit bold. Putting such an emphasis on how we feel about ourselves is also too speculative for my taste. Sure, it is a strange situation to have a consciousness try to understand the phenomenon of consciousness through the less of its own consciousness. A [strange loop](#Strange-Loops-and-Tangled-Hierarchies), yes, but is this necessarily limiting us in any fundamental way?

Recall my example of how I could not comprehend how by virtue of just knowing that there is a space drawn on my ace, my chance of holding two aces increases. I eventually understood the intuition behind the solution, but it still competes with the primal intuition I first formed when looking at the problem.
Here, my mind is also holding a conflicting set of beliefs: one thinks the result is magical, the other one knows it is mundane. This does not hinder me from understanding the solution because as a human I have the ability of metacognition, noticing the flaws in the way my mind works if I look carefully enough.

TODO: Add ambiguous image like "My Wife and My Mother-in-Law". Just as I can flip between seeing a young and an old woman but never both at the same time, I can flip between the intuitive and the real answer to problems my intuition is not built for.

Granted, I will probably always see my consciousness as magical, but that should not stop me from also knowing that it is not. Just as I have the ability to see the world as deterministic even though everything in my being screams against it, I believe one day someone will be able to see the way flesh and electricity, and even mere equations, give rise to consciousness
